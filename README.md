# Project Name

Redux Feedback Loop

## Description

Duration: 2 day sprint

Created a feedback form to see how students at Prime Digital Academy are feeling about their experience. Feedback is collected over 4 views and then a fifth review page that displays their fedback and has a submit button that sends the feedback to the database. I created to following to-do list beforehand to track my progress and ensure all features were completed:

- [x] npm installs
- [x] created database in Postico
- [x] wrote boilerplate language in index. js: created store, reducers, etc (feelingsReducer, understandingReducer, supportReducer, commentsReducer)
- [x] created different routes using react router dom.
- [x] POST route and query text needed on server side
- [x] used a form for feeling, understanding, support, and comments feedback to capture user input and dispatch to store.
- [x] these forms need input validation to make sure user submits a ranking
- [x] used useSelector in review page and displayed previous feedback on DOM
- [x] sent feedback to database via axios POST on click of submit button
- [x] thank you page displays after submit button is clicked, inputs are cleared, and user is given the option to fill out feedback for a different day.
